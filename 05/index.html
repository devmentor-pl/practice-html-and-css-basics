        <h2>Octatrack</h2>
        <p>More than a sampler
            Discovering the perfect sample is the start of the process. Then twist it, mess around with it and rebuild it into something uniquely yours. The Octatrack MKII sets new standards for sampling as an art form.

        <h2>Digitone</h2>
        <p>
            Master of the digital method
            The sound of steel monoliths and flickering neons signs. Icy, metallic perfection. Magnificent desolation. Through the unique and accessible take on FM synthesis, Digitone is a prime source of new sounds and timbres. Down the rabbit hole we go.

      <h3>Bionic Walk</h3>
      <p>You’ll find a plethora of glitchy, edgy percussive sounds in this collection. Drums conceived via filter. Rich, harmonic sounds sizzling with evolving frequencies. Micro rhythms brought to life through various synthetic tricks and twiddles. There are some great pads, chords and arpeggio sounds in here, too.

      <h3>Disturbance</h3>
      <p>As a first, exclusively for Elektron, ModeAudio has created a collection of very special samples for the Octatrack.
          The vast majority of these are of the lush, atmospheric and ambient kind. They are not of the shopping mall or mental ward variety: they definitely aren’t designed to pass through your system without stirring anything inside.
