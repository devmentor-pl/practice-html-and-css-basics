# Practice HTML and CSS Basics

This repository contains a set of exercises in HTML and CSS that I completed to refresh and strengthen my knowledge.  
Each task is placed in a separate folder (`01` – `05`) with my own commits documenting the learning process.

## What I Learned

- Reviewed **HTML semantics** – proper use of elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`.
- Practiced creating **forms**: input fields, textarea, select, radio buttons, checkboxes, and their attributes.
- Strengthened knowledge of **CSS styling**: selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, inheritance, and specificity.
- Gained experience in building **page layouts** using **Flexbox**.
- Learned best practices for **code readability and organization**.

## Solutions I Used

- Semantic HTML structures instead of overusing `div` elements.
- **Flexbox** for simpler layouts (e.g., navigation bars, forms) and also more complex multi-column and multi-row layouts.
- Organized CSS with **cascading rules** and grouped selectors to avoid code repetition.
- Kept HTML and CSS in separate files for better project structure.

## Tasks Overview

- [**Task 01**](https://github.com/ArturDevCraft/practice-html-and-css-basics/tree/main/01) – Built a basic semantic HTML structure as the foundation for later styling.
- [**Task 02**](https://github.com/ArturDevCraft/practice-html-and-css-basics/tree/main/02) – Add missing CSS selectors to the code.
- [**Task 03**](https://github.com/ArturDevCraft/practice-html-and-css-basics/tree/main/03) – Used three methods to set elements positions on page
- [**Task 04**](https://github.com/ArturDevCraft/practice-html-and-css-basics/tree/main/04) – Created a multi-level drop-down menu
- [**Task 05**](https://github.com/ArturDevCraft/practice-html-and-css-basics/tree/main/05) – Created a website layout using **flexbox**

## Highlights

- Each folder shows my **iterative process** – from a simple structure to a polished result.
- Demonstrated both **Flexbox** and older approaches to layout building. It could help me work with legacy code.
- Paid attention to **semantic HTML**, making the code accessible and clean.
- Used **consistent commit messages** to track the development progress.
