            <h1>Space voyage is the future!</h1>

            During the time that has passed since the launching of the first artificial satellite in 1957,
            astronauts have traveled to the moon, probes have explored the solar system, and instruments in space 
            have discovered thousands of planets around other stars.

            On June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private 
            astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft 
            and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD 
            per day for one astronaut, and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.

            Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace 
            companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending
            space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship.
